# py-boggle (GUI)
## ðŸ“™ About the project

An implementation of the 'Boggle' game.

In this game, each dice is marked with a letter (or several), forming a 4x4
dice board. there is only one player, and the player has three minutes to get as
many points as possible by finding legal words on the board.

Legal words appear in the dictionary and consist of a route on the game
board that starts with one letter and goes to neighboring letters, when it is
forbidden to use the same dice more than once.

The length of each word's route is calculated into a square score; i.e. for a
word of length N, you will receive N<sup>2</sup> points.

## ðŸš© Getting started

run:

```shell
> python boggle.py
```

The program uses `tkinter`, Python's standard GUI package. If you do not
already have `tkinter`, you can install it with:

```shell
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```
